# One Click AKS
## Introduction
I am not sure about that name. its not easy to name things. Idea is to make creating various ways to deploy AKS clusters with minimum efforts possible.

I initially planned to write all TF code in this repo, but quickly realized thats not easy! Thus now using Azure-Terraform modules to create resources.

All contributions are welcome. You know the drill!
