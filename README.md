# One Click AKS
## Introduction
I am not sure about that name, its not easy to name things you know!. Idea is to deploy AKS clusters in diffenet ways with minimum efforts possible.

I initially planned to write all TF code in this repo, but quickly realized thats not easy and who doesn't like easy! Thus now using Azure-Terraform modules to create resources.

All contributions are welcome. You know the drill!
